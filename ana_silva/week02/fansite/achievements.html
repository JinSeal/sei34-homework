    <aside>
      <p>In high school Fran was greatly inspired by her math teacher, and set out to become a math teacher herself.</p>
      <p>She made up a course called "General Maths" to help the kids that were going to be farmers and could not afford to go to college. It helped them with practical things like keeping books, doing taxes, measurements, etc.</p>
      <p>Fran enrolled at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and earned an MA in mathematics.</p>
