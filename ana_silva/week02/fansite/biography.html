      <h1>Fran Allen Biography</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>Frances Allen was born in Plattsburg, New York, in 1932. She holds a B.S. in mathematics (1954) from Albany State Teacher's College, and an M.S., also in mathematics (1957), from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Allen began her career at a small rural high school in Peru, New York, teaching practical math to farm kids, then took a job at IBM in order to earn the money she needed to pay off her college loans. She had planned to work there for a couple of years and then return to her first love-teaching-but at IBM, she found something she loved even more, "great people." She would stay at IBM for the next 45 years, making dozens of important and original contributions to computer science.</p>
      <p>She was first hired to teach staff scientists a new computer programming language named FORTRAN. During the 1960s Allen worked on compilers for IBM supercomputers, such as the IBM 7030 (known as Stretch) and the IBM 7950 (known as Harvest), that were ordered by the U.S. National Security Agency for delivery to Los Alamos National Laboratory. Stretch was one of the first supercomputers, and Harvest was a coprocessor for Stretch that had been designed for the US National Security Agency (NSA) to do codebreaking of secret messages.</p>

      <p>Allen and her team designed a single compiler framework to handle three very different programming languages: FORTRAN, Autocoder (a business language similar to COBOL), and the new language Alpha (designed for rapidly detecting patterns in arbitrary text represented in any alphabet). </p>

      <p> Late 70's, she joined Project Y, which allowed her to collaborate once again with John Cocke, another future Turing Award winner who had worked on the hardware for Stretch. Project Y, later called the Advanced Computing Systems project (ACS). The hardware might be described in today's terms as the first "superscalar" processor, where the central processing unit does not execute instructions one at a time as in previous designs, but works on several instructions at once, perhaps even performing instructions "in the wrong order" to get the work done more quickly.</p>

      <p>She took a sabbatical from IBM to teach graduate courses on compilers at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences at New York University at the invitation of Jacob "Jack" Schwartz, creator of the SETL programming language and the NYU Ultracomputer at the Courant Institute. Schwartz had previously visited IBM to collaborate with her and John Cocke on ACS. Later, she and Schwartz were married. </p>

      <p>Allen's last big project for IBM was the Parallel Translator (PTRAN), a system for compiling Fortran programs not specially written with parallelism in mind for execution on parallel computer architectures. She retired from IBM in 2002. As an IBM Fellow Emerita, she has continued to advise IBM on a number of projects including the Blue Gene supercomputer, and has worked to encourage the involvement of other women in computer-related fields.</p>
