      <p><span class="bold">Frances "Fran" Elizabeth Allen</span> is an American computer scientist known for her contributions to programming language compilers.</p>

      <p>Frances is an IBM Fellow Emerita at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center, NY. Starting as a programmer at IBM Research in July 1957, her first assignment was to teach the research scientists Fortran, a new high-level language IBM had announced 3 months earlier. This was the beginning of Allen’s career-long focus on compilers for high-performance computing.</p>

      <p class="inset">A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.</p>
