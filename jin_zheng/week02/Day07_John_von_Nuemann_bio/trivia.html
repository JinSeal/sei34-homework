                                <p>In  1955, von Neumann was diagnosed with what was either bone or pancreatic cancer. He had earlier confided to his mother, "There probably has to be a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't." Father Strittmatter administered the last rites to him. Some of von Neumann's friends said they had always believed him to be "completely agnostic". Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told Heims, "He was of course completely agnostic all his life, and then he suddenly turned Catholic—it doesn't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude, outlook and thinking when he was healthy."</p>

He never used it, preferring the couple's living room with its television playing loudly.</p>

                                <p>Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was mathematician Stanisław Ulam. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural.</p>
