          <p class="clearfix first-paragraph">The mission could have been aborted but thanks to Margaret Hamilton and her code to prevent user-errors, the landing was safe and three minutes later a human placed their feet on the moon for the first time in history. Margaret Hamilton spent long hours at MIT’s Apollo project from NASA, leading the Software Engineering Division responsible for the unmanned missions on-board flight software. </p>
          <p>Often on nights and weekends, she took her daughter Lauren to work and she would see Margaret use the simulator’s display-and-keyboard unit (DSKY) to test the software. One day, wanting to play astronaut, Lauren crashed the simulator and Margaret realized it was because she had selected the pre-launch program PO1 during “flight”. She instantly started to worry about the debug session her daughter had adventured and asked herself “What if the astronaut did what she just did?”.</p>
          <p id="apollo-quote">“It quickly became clear that the software was not only informing everyone that there was a hardware-related problem, but that the software was compensating for it.”</p>

          <p class="clearfix middle-paragraph">Marget Hamilton suggested a program change to prevent a prelaunch program being selected during flight. But the higher-ups at MIT and Nasa said the astronauts were too well trained to make such a mistake. Midcourse on the very next mission – Apollo 8 – one of the astronauts on board accidentally did exactly what Lauren had done. It created much havoc and required the mission to be reconfigured. After that, they let her put the program change in, all right. Just as the astronauts were about to land, the software’s priority displays interrupted them with alarms to warn there was an emergency, and that the computer was overloaded. She learned about it as it was happening, standing in the monitoring room at MIT. Her team pieced together afterwards what had happened, which was that a radar switch was in the wrong position and it was taking up processing power. </p>
          <p>Her team pieced together afterwards what had happened, which was that a radar switch was in the wrong position and it was taking up processing power. It quickly became clear the software was not only informing everyone that there was a hardware-related problem but was compensating for it – restarting and re-establishing the highest priority tasks. The error detection and recovery mechanisms had come to the rescue. It was a total relief when they landed – both that the astronauts were safe, and that the software worked perfectly.</p>
