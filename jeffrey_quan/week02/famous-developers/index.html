        <p>Largely creditted with coining, or at least popularising, the term "software engineering", Margaret Heafield Hamilton is a pioneer in computer science and software engineering. Most notably she led the team that created the onboard flight software for the Apollo missions, including Apollo 11 in 1969. <a class="link" href="apollo.html">Read more.</a></p>
        <p>In 1955, Margaret Hamilton studied mathematics at the University of Michigan before transferring to Earlham College in Indiana, where she graduated with a BA in Mathetics in 1958. At the time, there were no degrees for computer science and software engineering. Instead, programmers had to learn on the job.</p>
        <p>In 1958, Margaret moved to Boston where her first husband, James Cox Hamilton, was studying chemistry at Brandeis Unversity. While at Boston, in the summer of 1959, she began working with Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology depart at MIT. She developed software for predicting weather. This was where she learn what a computer was and how to write software. Edward Lorenz' love for experimenting with software inspired Margaret to push the boundaries of software.</p>
