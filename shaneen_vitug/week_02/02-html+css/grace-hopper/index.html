      <h1>GRACE HOPPER</h1>
      <p>“People have an enormous tendency to resist change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try
        to
        fight that.”
        —Grace Hopper</p>

        <p>Grace Hopper joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the Mark I computer. She
          continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the first computer language
          compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language.</p>
        <p>Hopper noticed that many people did not further invest their time in computer science because they found it
          hard to understand Executable Machine Code. This lead to Hopper’s creation of the compiler; which today
          translates high-level programming languages (such as Java or Python) to a language in which computers could
          understand.</p>
        <p>At first, many people were skeptical of her idea, believing that computers could never understand English.
          However, Hopper developed the first known compiler, known as the B-O compiler, which could understand 20
          English
          statements. This was a marvelous discovery, as computers have only been able to understand lower-level
          programming languages, which was very difficult to understand (imagine coding using only 1’s and 0’s). Later
          on,
          she developed the COBOL compiler, a more advanced compiler that could understand even more statements in
          English. Compilers are used to this day by most computer scientists, making computer science more accessible
          and
          easier to learn.</p>
        <p>Hopper also coined the word ‘bug.’ In the 1940s, her team was working on a computer glitch, only to
          discover
          the problem was a bug—a live bug, that is: a moth stuck in an electrical switch. Hence, they ‘debugged’ the
          first computer.</p>

        <p>These days, children are learning basic coding skills in elementary school, in large part because of
          Hopper’s
          work and persistence. It was her belief that coding should be easy for anyone, not just highly trained
          mathematicians.</p>

        <h4>DID YOU KNOW?</h4>
        <p>Grace Hopper became the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University in 1934.</p>
        <p>In 1952, Grace Hopper and her team created the first compiler for computer languages.</p>
        <p>Grace Hopper became the first female individual recipient of the National Medal of Technology in 1991.</p>
        <p>When she retired from the U.S. Navy in 1986, at age 79, Grace Hopper was the oldest serving officer in
          the
          service.</p>
        <p>The USS Hopper, a naval ship that was commissioned in 1997, was named in Grace Hopper's honor.</p>
        <p>Grace Hopper appeared on television with David Letterman in 1986, during which she explained
          nanoseconds
          and
          picoseconds to her host.</p>

      <h2>WHAT IS COBOL PROGRAMMING?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="cobol">
      <p>COBOL is a high-level programming language primarily used for business applications. At the time of its
        creation, it was the first popular language designed to be Operating System agnostic (can run on any Operating
        System) and is still in use in many financial and business applications today.</p>
      <p>COBOL is also still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as
        large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs.</p>
      <p>It was officially standardized in 1968 and has received four major revisions over the years. Expansions
        include
        support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.</p>
      <p>Although it is still in use around the world, it is declining in popularity. Its decline is also compounded
        by
        the fact that many experienced COBOL programmers are reaching, or have reached retirement age.</p>
