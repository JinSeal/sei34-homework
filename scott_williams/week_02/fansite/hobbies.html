        <h3>Hobbies of Sophie Wilson</h3>
        <p>Sophie Wilson loves her digital camera (she could be biased because the camera is probably driven by the circuit boards she first designed back in 1985).</p>
        <p>She is involved in your local theatre group and has acted in a number of productions.</p>
        <p>Sophie has been known to look after a children's creche at the Hartington Grove Quaker Sunday morning meeting.</p>
        <p>She likes gardening. To be truthful, she likes others getting in and helping her garden. One of her favourite garden modifications is the pond and bridge addition to her backyard.
