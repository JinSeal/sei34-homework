// - Use jQuery to get the contents of the div as a string, then split up the string into an array of words.
// - Re-use the `getRandomElementFromArray()` function we wrote at the end of week 1 to pick a random word from the array.
// - Use jQuery to 1) create a new DIV with that word as its contents, 2) set the DIV to appear at a random position on the page , and 3) append it to the DOM.
