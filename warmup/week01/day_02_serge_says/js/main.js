// ## Warmup - Serge Says
//
// ## Examples
// * Serge answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
//
// * He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).
//
// * He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
//
// * He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
//
// * Create a function that takes an input and returns Serge's response.

// so we want to create a function where we can input a string and output a different repsonse depending
// if the input has a question mark, all caps, is empty or is any string
